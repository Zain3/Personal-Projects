To start this project, first, activate the virtual environment:
.\tfod\Scripts\activate

Then, run the command "jupyter notebook" to start up the jupyter notebook. Make sure the kernel name is the name of the virtual environment you've selected, so everything you install and download is done WITHIN the virtual environment.
